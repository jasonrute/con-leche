# ι through the projections, with no certificate (task #350)

**The question** (maintainer, 2026-10-12).  After Lean's kernel logic
renovation (lean4#14977) a family that may be `Prop` eliminates into
every sort only when it has no constructor, has K, or has structure η:
a non-recursive, non-indexed, non-impredicative structure (`And`,
`PUnit.{u}`, a sort-polymorphic `PSigma'.{u,v} : Sort (max u v)`),
every field of which is a proof wherever the structure is a
proposition.  Can ι on such a structure go through its projections,

  `S.rec ps motive minor x  ⟶  minor (S.p₀ ps x) … (S.pₖ ps x)`,

instead of reading the fields off a constructor literal, and need no
certificate?  (#349's counterexample shows that plain ι on a literal,
at a valuation where the family is `Prop`, needs a full-grade
certificate on every field: the literal is the point, so its arguments
are unconstrained.)

**The answer: yes, provided the step takes the major as it stands —
not its reduct.**

* `Red.iotaEta_core_sem` / `Red.iotaEta_sound`: the step is sound under
  the conditional claims with no certificate, no comparison (levels,
  parameters, indices) and no reduction of the major, given the
  environment's plain ι law (`RecRuleLaw`, already an `EnvModel`
  field) and the structure-η law on values (`StructEtaLaw`, the
  installation's obligation: every member of the structure's fibre is
  the constructor at its projections, which are typed).  The redex is
  not the point, so the whole spine — the major included — fits the
  recursor's telescope (`teleFit_of_ne_pt`); the projections are then
  applied to a major in its own domain, and their values are fixed by
  the major's value alone.  At a valuation where the structure is a
  proposition that value is the point, the projections of the point
  are the point (`projPt_of_fieldSort`: a field's type is a proposition
  wherever the structure is — non-impredicativity), and the reduct is
  the minor at the point, which is the recursor's value there.
* `Red.projCtor_core_sem`: the projection of a constructor literal
  (`S.pᵢ qs maj ⟶ fᵢ` where `maj` reduces to `S.mk … fs`) is sound with
  no certificate — the step #347 already freed of `projCertAt`.
  Where the structure is a proposition the redex is the point (the
  same `projPt_of_fieldSort`) and nothing is claimed; where
  it is not, the major is not the point, so its reduction is claimed,
  and the literal fits the constructor's telescope.
* **The chain** (`Red.trans`, `Red.appFn`, the `DefEq` consumers).  The
  eta reduct holds `S.pᵢ ps (S.mk ps n b)` for a literal major; it
  denotes the point at a propositional valuation, and its reduct `n`
  may be anything there.  That reduct is never consumed at such a
  valuation: `Red` has no congruence in argument position; a `Red`
  claim is consumed only on a subject that is not the point
  (`trans`: the middle term has the first term's denotation;
  `appFn`: the head of an application that is not the point is not
  the point); `DefEq`'s claim is about two sides that are both
  well-denoted and not the point, and each side is a subterm of the
  conclusion or a reduct whose invariant a claim supplied; the
  projection's own reduction is claimed only when the projection is
  not the point, which forces the structure to be a type.  The one
  place a reduct of a point-denoting term was consumed is plain ι's
  major (#347's `major_eq`, case 3 of the certificate table), which
  this path does not use.
* **Eta on the reduct of the major is not covered**
  (`etaIota_reduced_major_witness`).  A major that denotes the point
  may reduce to a term that is not well-denoted (a β-redex whose
  argument lies outside its λ's domain: a λ that is the point
  constrains nothing), so `minor (S.p₀ ps maj')` is not well-denoted
  although the redex is, and the reduction's claim fails.  The checker
  must eta-expand the major as it finds it (as lean4#15371 does,
  before `whnf` of the major), and must not first reduce it to a
  literal.  Its value is still right (the projections of the point are
  the point); whether a verdict-level counterexample exists is not
  settled here, the claim is what fails.
* **The contrast with plain ι** (`plainIota_literal_witness`): #349's
  counterexample on values — at the same redex, the plain reduct
  `minor n` is not well-denoted, the eta reduct `minor (S.p₀ (S.mk n))`
  is and has the redex's value.
* **K and structure η** (`recRuleLawK_of_eta`, `iotaEta_noFields`): for
  a structure with no fields (`True`, `PUnit`) the eta reduct is the K
  reduct, syntactically, and the structure-η law with the plain law
  gives the K law (#349's `RecRuleLawK`): the two paths coincide.
  Since #342 F2 the K law is itself an environment law
  (`EnvModel.rec_rules_k`, proved by inversion of the least fixed
  point, `IndSpec.rec_rule_lawK`) and K a rule (`Red.iotaK`); the
  theorem here shows the eta route reaches the same law.

The fragment has no projections, so the projection functions are
stored constants read only through the laws, and the two steps are
theorems about the claims, not rules of `Red` (as #349 did for K,
which #342 F2 has since made the rule `Red.iotaK`): a
rule needs an `EnvModel` field for `StructEtaLaw`/`ProjLaw` and its
proof in the installer (the projections read the unique decoding of a
member of the fibre, `Uniq.lean`, which at a proposition has every
field the point when every field's sort is zero), threaded through
`transport`, `InstallDef` and `InstallNest`.

the major at `majorIdx`, and its one rule's constructor `mk` stored as
`cij` at the recursor's last levels (`us.drop d`, `d` the elimination
level in front): whenever values `xs` and a major `x` fit the
recursor's telescope, each projection applied to the parameters and
`x` is a well-formed application chain, the parameters and the
projections' values fit the constructor's telescope, and `x` is the
constructor at them.

In the inductive model the projections read the unique decoding of a
member of the fibre (`IndSpec.Mem`, `Uniq`), so this is the decoding's
existence.  Where the structure is a type, the member is the tagged
tuple of its fields.  Where it is a proposition, the member is the
point, every field's domain is a truth value (the renovation's
non-impredicativity: a field's sort is at most the structure's), so
every field of the decoding is the point, the projections of the
point are the point (`projPt_of_fieldSort`), and the constructor
applied to anything is the point. -/

/-! ## The witnesses

Closed terms over constants, at a model of the empty environment
(`EnvModel.empty`) that gives the constants the values of a valuation
where the structure is a proposition: the constructor `mk` and the
projection `p0` are the point (as they are there), the minor is a
graph over `{pt}` (`True → Nat`-like, the field's domain a truth
value), the recursor sends a minor `m` to `fun x => m x` (its value at
the point is the minor at the point), `n` and `a` denote `True` — a
value outside `{pt}`, ill-slotted as a field.  The terms are not typed
by a checker; the witnesses are about the reduction **claims** (as
`lam_congr_untyped_unsound` is), which the soundness proof needs of
every step it takes. -/
