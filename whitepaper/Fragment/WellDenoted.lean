# The semantic invariant `WellDenoted`

There is no typing judgement in the proof.  In its place stands a
**semantic** judgement on terms, `WellDenoted M φ ρ e`, defined by
recursion on the term: it holds of a term when it holds of the
subterms and one condition on the term's own shape is met.  The
invariant **records what is a type** — a truth value or a strict set
(`IsTy`, `Lib.lean`), the sets whose members are all the point or none
of them:

* an application applies a member of some product `piR p A B` to a
  member of its domain `A`; at a proposition (`p`) the fibres are truth
  values, above it the domain is a type;
* a λ's domain is a type, the body is well-denoted at every value of
  the domain, and some family of types bounds it;
* a Π's domain is a type, the body is well-denoted at every value of
  the domain and denotes a type there;
* variables, sorts and constants are always well-denoted.

There is no annotation to hold to account (task #344): the regime of a
binder is read off these values by the interpretation, and the type
clauses are what makes that reading coherent — an abstraction is a
member of its product (`SetLib.lamV_mem`) because every fibre is a
type.  The predicate transports along `Expr.inst` by the substitution
lemmas of `Interp.lean` (`WellDenoted_inst0`); a β step at a redex that
is not the point keeps the denotation and the invariant
(`Sound.lean`, `Red.beta_sound`).

A **context** `Γ` is satisfied by an environment `ρ` (`Sat`) when each
`Γ[i]` is well-denoted and a type under the rest of `ρ`, and `ρ i` a
member of it — the semantic reading of `Γ ⊢`.

Con-leche's `ConLeche/Semantics/WellDenoted.lean` is the same recursive
definition on `AnnotTerm` without the type clauses (its sorts denote
the universes, where every set is a type).
